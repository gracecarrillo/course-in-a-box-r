In this crash course, we start from the very beginning, with basic arithmetic and variables, and learn how to handle data structures, such as Python lists, Numpy arrays, and Pandas DataFrames. We'll learn about Python functions and control flow. Plus, we'll look at the world of data visualizations with Python and create our own stunning visualizations based on real data.
