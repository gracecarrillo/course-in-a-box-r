R is a very popular programming language for the world of data analysis, data science and statistical computing. The journey of the R language from a rudimentary text editor to the interactive R Studio, Jupyter Notebooks and more recently, Google Collaboratory notebooks, has engaged many scientists across the world.
<br>
This was possible only because of generous contributions by R users globally. The inclusion of powerful packages in R has made it more and more powerful with time. Packages such as dplyr, tidyr, readr, data.table, SparkR, ggplot2 have made data manipulation, visualization and computation much faster.
