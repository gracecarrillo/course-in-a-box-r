- The art of decision making choosing a plan of action when faced with **uncertainty**.
- The quantitative approach to decision making is the essence of Data Science.
- We are just going to refresh a bit of this quantitative approach called **Statistics**.
- Statistics is part of the art of unraveling the secrets hidden inside data.

### "A Data Scientist is one who knows more statistics than a programmer and more programming than a statistician".

### A data scientists solves problems 

- We define a problem statement (**By asking the right questions**)
- We then collect the **right kind** of data to perform our analysis
- We try to explore the data to see what it tells us
- We employ various techniques to derive inferences from the data or to predict some answers for the problem statement.
- Finally, we check if our inferences/predictions are fairly accurate (of course by scientific methods!)
