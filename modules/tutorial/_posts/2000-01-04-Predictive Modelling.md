### Predictive modeling is a process that uses *data* and *statistics* to predict outcomes with data models. 


Often used interchangeably:

- Predictive analytics: More like commercial applications of predictive modeling.
- Predictive modeling: Used more generally or academically. 
- Machine learning: Use of statistical techniques to allow a computer to construct predictive models.


We as **data scientists** perform all these heavy-lifting of data by instructing computers step by step. But we can teach the computers to build and perfect models on their own.

### So the art of teaching the machines to learn from past data, their statistics and the probabilities of the recurrence, is known as **Machine Learning**.

Machine learning models typically fall into two categories: **supervised learning** and **unsupervised learning**. 

**Classification** and **regression** algorithms are two types of **supervised learning**.

In this crash course, we will look at three types of **regression** algorightms: OLS Linear Regression (which you should be already familiar to from your Statistics module!), Decision Tree Regressor and Random Forest.
